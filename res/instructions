Buttons:
GREEN ARROW - start measurement
RED ARROW - stop measurement and calculate charge of a drop
FLOPPY DISK-
FLAG - change language
LIGHT BULB - activate/deactivate one of the photodetectors

SLIDER AND TEXT FIELD setting the values of voltage of the capacitor

1) Start a measurement by clicking green arrow button
2) Activate first photodetector by clicking left light bulb button
3) The free fall velocity will be measured, you will know if its complete when two small diodes on photodetector
   turn blue
4) Allow the drop to fall into the capacitor
5) By adjusting voltage of the capacitor increase the electric field and force the drop to move upwards
6) Activate second photodetector by clicking on the right light bulb button
7) Measure the upward velocity of the drop
8) When both velocities are measured click on the red arrow button to calculate the charge of the drop
9) Repeat all over again and observe estimated unitary charge value
